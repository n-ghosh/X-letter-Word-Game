# X-letter-Word-Game

Welcome to X-letter Word Game, a brain-teasing game designed to challenge your working memory, logical thinking, and language skills. The objective of the game is simple: guess the secret word!

## How to Play

1. The game selects a random word as the secret word.
2. Your task is to guess a word with the same length as the secret word.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback on how many letters in your word are in the secret word and how many of those letters are in the correct position.
4. Use the feedback to refine your guesses and deduce the secret word.
